### EC2(elastic cloud compute) instance:
------------
whenever aws provides you a service that is elastic in nature means it can be scaled up and scaled down you will see the service name with a prefix of elastic .
types of ec2 instances :

| **Type**                  | **Optimized for**                 | **Example use**                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Purpose**       | Balanced CPU, memory, and storage | Websites, apps, small databases                       |
| **Compute Optimized**     | Lots of processing power (CPU)    | Gaming servers, video processing, scientific modeling |
| **Memory Optimized**      | Large memory (RAM)                | Big databases, in-memory caching, analytics           |
| **Storage Optimized**     | Fast and large storage (disks)    | Big data, file systems, data warehouses               |
| **Accelerated Computing** | Special hardware (GPU or FPGA)    | Machine learning, 3D rendering, AI, simulations       |

üåê VPC (VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD):

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private section of the AWS cloud ‚Äî where you can safely run your servers (EC2 instances), databases, and apps.
Your VPC is your own fenced neighborhood inside that city ‚Äî private, secure, and only you can decide who enters or leaves.

üè† Example
Let‚Äôs say you want to host a small website.
You create a VPC ‚Äî your private network in AWS.
Inside the VPC, you make:

a Public Subnet ‚Üí where your web server (EC2) lives so people can visit your website.
a Private Subnet ‚Üí where your database lives so the public can‚Äôt access it directly.
You set up Security Groups and Firewalls (rules) to control who can talk to what.
You can connect your home or office network to it using a VPN if needed.


| Component                  | Description                                            | Example / Analogy                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **VPC**                    | Main private network container                         | Your private neighborhood             |
| **Subnet**                 | Smaller section inside VPC (can be public or private)  | A street in your neighborhood         |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Connects VPC to the Internet                           | The main gate to the outside world    |
| **Route Table**            | Tells each subnet where to send traffic                | The road map                          |
| **Security Group**         | Firewall at instance level                             | Guard at your house gate              |
| **Network ACL (NACL)**     | Firewall at subnet level                               | Guard at the neighborhood gate        |
| **NAT Gateway**            | Lets private subnets access internet **outbound only** | One-way gate for updates/downloads    |
| **Load Balancer (LB)**     | Distributes traffic across servers                     | Reception desk that forwards visitors |


| Type               | Internet Access                  | Route Table Entry                 | Typical Use                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Public Subnet**  | ‚úÖ Direct Internet access via IGW | `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí Internet Gateway`    | Load Balancers, Web Servers |
| **Private Subnet** | ‚ùå No direct Internet access      | `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway` or none | App Servers, Databases      |

üöÄ Traffic Flow Example

User ‚Üí Website in VPC (Project 1)
User types URL ‚Üí DNS resolves to LB‚Äôs public IP.
Request goes through the Internet ‚Üí Internet Gateway (IGW).
IGW passes traffic to Public Subnet (where Load Balancer lives).
LB forwards request to Private Subnet (App Server).
App Server (if needed) talks to Database in another private subnet.
Response goes back ‚Üí Private Subnet ‚Üí Public Subnet (LB) ‚Üí IGW ‚Üí Internet ‚Üí User.
