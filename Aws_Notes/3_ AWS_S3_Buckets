 AWS S3(simple storage service) Buckets:
---------------------
Amazon S3 is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that stores files on the internet (cloud storage). Think of it like a giant online hard drive.
Buckets are like folders or containers in that storage. Every file you want to save goes into a bucket.

** Key points about buckets:
     Each bucket has a unique name. No two buckets in S3 can have the same name.
     You can store unlimited files inside a bucket.
     You can control who can see or edit the files in your bucket.
     Files in S3 are called objects, and each object is stored in a bucket.
**Analogy:
     Imagine your computer. S3 is the computerâ€™s hard drive.
     Buckets are like folders on that hard drive.
     Objects/files are like the documents or pictures inside those folders.

Extra tip: You can access files in a bucket from anywhere over the internet if you set permissions correctly.
