 AWS S3(simple storage service) Buckets:
---------------------
Amazon S3 is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that stores files on the internet (cloud storage). Think of it like a giant online hard drive.
Buckets are like folders or containers in that storage. Every file you want to save goes into a bucket.

** Key points about buckets:
     Each bucket has a unique name. No two buckets in S3 can have the same name.
     You can store unlimited files inside a bucket.
     You can control who can see or edit the files in your bucket.
     Files in S3 are called objects, and each object is stored in a bucket.
**Analogy:
     Imagine your computer. S3 is the computer’s hard drive.
     Buckets are like folders on that hard drive.
     Objects/files are like the documents or pictures inside those folders.

Extra tip: You can access files in a bucket from anywhere over the internet if you set permissions correctly.

👇 Here are the main advantages of Amazon S3 buckets, explained simply 👇

1 Easy to use – You can upload, download, and manage files easily through the AWS console, command line, or code.
2 Scalable – You can store any amount of data, from a few files to millions, without worrying about running out of space(jst one object/file size can not exceed more than 5 TB).
3 Durable and reliable – S3 automatically makes multiple copies of your data across different locations, so it’s very safe (99.999999999% durability!).
4 Secure – You can control who can access your data with permissions, encryption, and access policies.
5 Cost-effective – You pay only for what you use, and there are different storage classes for different needs (e.g., cheaper for rarely accessed files).
6 Accessible from anywhere – Your files can be reached from any device or location over the internet (with the right permissions).
7 Integrated with other AWS services – Works smoothly with tools like AWS Lambda, EC2, and CloudFront.
8 Versioning – Keeps older versions of files so you can recover them if needed.


🧱  how aws ensure that the s3 buckets are 99.99999999999% secure:

1. Multiple Copies (Replication)
     When you upload a file, S3 automatically creates several copies of it.
     These copies are stored in different physical locations (called Availability Zones) within the same region.
     So even if one data center fails, your file still exists in others.
2. Automatic Data Repair
     S3 constantly checks your data for errors or corruption.
     If it detects a problem, it automatically repairs it using one of the other healthy copies.
3. Strong Security and Encryption
     Data can be encrypted both while it’s being sent (in transit) and while it’s stored (at rest).
     You can also control who can access your buckets with IAM policies, bucket policies, and ACLs.
4. Highly Redundant Infrastructure
      AWS runs S3 on many servers across many facilities, so even if hardware or an entire building fails, your data stays safe.
5. Regular Audits and Certifications
     AWS data centers meet strict security and compliance standards (like ISO 27001, SOC 1/2/3, etc.).
     They’re regularly audited to ensure the safety and durability of your data.

Create S3 bucket:

choose region >> give bucket name (unique) >> object ownership >> Block Public Access settings for this bucket >> Bucket Versioning (Disabled/Enabled) >> Tag (jst a unique identifier) >> Default encryption
>> Bucket Key >> create bucket

🗂️ Amazon S3 Storage Classes (Explained Simply):  

| Storage Class                                              | Description                                                                                | When to Use                                                                        | Cost 💰                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1. S3 Standard**                                         | Default storage class — data is stored across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).           | For data you access **frequently** (websites, apps, daily files).                  | 💲💲 (Regular price)                           |
| **2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering**                              | Automatically moves data between “frequent” and “infrequent” access tiers based on usage.  | When you **don’t know** how often data will be accessed.                           | 💲💲 (slightly higher but auto-optimizes cost) |
| **3. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)**         | Same durability as Standard, but cheaper for rarely accessed data. Retrieval costs extra.  | For **backups, logs, or old project files** you don’t use often.                   | 💲 (cheaper storage, cost per retrieval)       |
| **4. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)**         | Stores data in **only one Availability Zone** (not multi-AZ).                              | For **non-critical data** you can easily recreate if lost.                         | 💲 (even cheaper)                              |
| **5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**                        | Very low-cost storage for data that’s **rarely accessed** but needs **instant retrieval**. | For **archives or backups** you may occasionally need.                             | 💲 (cheap storage, small retrieval cost)       |
| **6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)** | Low-cost archival storage. Data retrieval takes **minutes to hours**.                      | For **long-term backups** (e.g., yearly archives).                                 | 💲 (very cheap)                                |
| **7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive**                             | Cheapest S3 storage — retrieval takes **12+ hours**.                                       | For **data you almost never access**, like compliance or old records.              | 💰 (cheapest)                                  |
| **8. S3 Outposts**                                         | Stores data on-premises using AWS Outposts hardware.                                       | For **local data residency** or when you need S3 features inside your data center. | 💲💲💲 (varies)                                |

## Requestor Pays:
-----------------

Normally, the bucket owner pays for all data transfer and access costs.
But with Requestor Pays, the person who downloads (requests) the data pays the cost instead.
s3 >> bucket >> properties >> scroll down to Requestor pay and enable

📦 Example:
You share a public S3 bucket full of large files (like maps or research data).
Lots of people download them — and you (the owner) get charged for every download.
To avoid that, you turn on Requestor Pays.
Now, anyone who downloads files must use their own AWS account, and they get billed for the data they access.

🧱 Key points:
Only works if the requestor has an AWS account.
The bucket owner still pays for storage, but not for data access or transfer.
The requestor must include --request-payer requester in their CLI or API calls.
🧰 Example AWS CLI command:   aws s3 ls s3://my-requestor-pays-bucket --request-payer requester

🔑 S3 object tagging :
--------------------
you can tag the object for identification .
if you want to access , move , delete , or do something on a group of objects you  can give same tags to all and use that tags .
