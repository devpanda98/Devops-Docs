Route53
---------

Route 53 is AWS’s DNS service that connects your domain name to your AWS resources, making it easy for users to reach your website without typing IP addresses.


How Route 53 Works:

Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53 for mywebsite.com.

Add a record:
Type: A (Address record)
Name: www
Value: 18.223.10.5 (EC2 public IP)
Users type www.mywebsite.com → Route 53 translates it → sends them to your EC2 server.

🔹 Optional: Using a Load Balancer
Instead of a single EC2 IP, you can point www.mywebsite.com to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
Route 53 will automatically route users to the healthy EC2 instances behind the ELB.

✅ Summary
Concept	Route 53 Function
Domain name	www.mywebsite.com
Maps to	EC2 IP, ELB, S3 bucket, etc.
Handles	DNS resolution + routing + failover + health checks


🔹 Key Features

Domain registration – You can buy and manage domain names directly in Route 53.
DNS routing – Maps domain names to AWS services like EC2, S3, Load Balancer, etc.
Health checks & failover – Automatically directs traffic to healthy servers.
Traffic routing policies – Simple routing, weighted, latency-based, geolocation, etc.

        EC2     EC2

* Explanation:

The user types the domain (www.mywebsite.com).
Route 53 receives the request and resolves the domain.
Traffic can go directly to a single EC2 or to a Load Balancer (ELB).
If using ELB, it distributes traffic to multiple EC2 instances behind it.
