1. Azure Resource : A resource is any manageable item available through Azure.   Examples include: A Virtual Machine (VM),A Storage Account

2. Resource Group (RG)
A Resource Group is a logical container that holds related Azure resources.
Think of it like a folder that keeps all the resources for a specific project or application together.
    üîπ Key points:
    Every resource in Azure must belong to one (and only one) resource group.
    You can manage all resources in a group together ‚Äî for example: Deploy,Update,Monitor,Delete
    Resource Groups simplify access control (you can assign permissions at the group level).
    They also define lifecycle boundaries ‚Äî deleting a resource group deletes all resources inside it.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
The Azure Resource Manager is the management layer (the service) that allows you to create, update, and delete resources in Azure.
Think of it as the engine behind all Azure operations.
         üîπ Key points:
          ARM provides a consistent management API for all Azure services.
          It handles requests whether you use:  The Azure Portal,The Azure CLI,PowerShell,REST APIs,ARM Templates / Bicep
          ARM enforces access control, tags, and policies.
          It supports declarative templates (Infrastructure as Code) for deployment.

üíª AZURE Virtual Machine:
-----
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem azureuser@<Public-IP>   (connect with the vm)
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/myazurevm.pem   (make sure the permissions are correct cause it will give bad permission error if the file has full permission )

Virtual Network (VNet):
------
