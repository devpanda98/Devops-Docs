Ip address:
Ip address numbers should be in 0 to 255 number only like 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255

Representation of IP address in ipv4 format:

0-255   . 0-255  .0-255   . 0-255
--------|--------|--------|--------
4 bytes |4 bytes |4 bytes |4 bytes
8 bit   | 8bit   |8bit    |8bit

🧩 Subnets:
2 types of subnets: public and private 
Only difference between these 2 are private subnet doesn’t have access to internet while Public subnet does .

🧱 CIDR range(Classless Inter-Domain Routing): 
 
So lets say you have to give a CIDR range in your vpc 
Vpc is 172.126.10.0  and you provide CIDR range which gives 172.126.10.0 /27 ips then how you calculate it 
So you know Ip address has 32 bit , you can calculate from that 
Like  32 – 27 = 5
2 to power 5 = 32, total 32 ip I will get like 172.126.10.0  - 172.126.10.31
The reason: Binary structure of IP addresses
This is a really insightful question! You're asking why IP address ranges always come in powers of 2, like 2¹, 2², 2⁵, 2¹⁶ — but never 2⁹ or 2¹¹ usable addresses, for example. Let's break it down.
1.	IP addresses are built in binary.
o	IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long.
o	Every bit can have 2 possible values: 0 or 1.
o	So, the number of possible addresses is always some power of 2.


Parameter                              | Formula / Rule                 | Example (172.198.10.0/27)
--------------------------------   ----|------------------------------ -|------------------------------
Total IPs                              | 2^(32 - CIDR)                  | 2^(32-27) = 32
Usable IPs                             | 2^(32 - CIDR) - 2              | 32 - 2 = 30 usable
Network IP                             | First IP of the block          | 172.198.10.0
Broadcast IP                           | Network IP + Total IPs - 1     | 172.198.10.0 + 32 - 1 = 172.198.10.31
Subnet increment / Next subnet start   | Network IP + Total IPs         | 172.198.10.0 + 32 = 172.198.10.32
Host bits                              | 32 - CIDR                      | 32 - 27 = 5 bits for hosts
Valid subnet alignment                 | Starting octet must be multiple of block size in that octet | 32 IPs → third octet multiples of 2: 0,2,4,6,8,10…


🌐 OSI models (open system interconnection)	
----------------------------------------------------------

The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model) is a conceptual framework that standardizes how different computer systems communicate over a network.
It divides the communication process into 7 layers, each with specific roles — from sending physical signals to displaying the final data to a user.

OSI HAS 7 LAYERS (APSTNDP in short):
1>> layer 7 >>  Application (http, https)
2>> layer 6 >> presentation (syntax, security & encryption)
3>> layer 5 >> session (API, Socket)
4>> layer 4 >> Transport (TCP)
5>> layer 3 >> Networks(packets)
6>> layer 2 >> Data link(ethernet)
7>> layer 1 >> Physical ()

##  the first 3 layers are called software layers,  the last 3 layers are called the hardware layers and the middle one (transport layer) is it handles the data communication between the software and hardware layers .
Understand like 
(7) Application – You write the letter
(6) Presentation – Translate it
(5) Session – Organize the conversation
(4) Transport – Deliver in correct order
(3) Network – Choose best route
(2) Data Link – Deliver to correct device
(1) Physical – Wires, Wi-Fi, actual delivery


COOMUNICATION PROTOCOLS: 
----------------------------
A communication protocol is like a set of rules that computers follow to talk to each other.
It decides how data is sent, received, and understood between two devices — like your phone and a website, or two servers.

| Protocol               | What it Does                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP / HTTPS**       | How web browsers talk to websites                 |
| **WebSocket**          | How live chats and games send instant messages    |
| **FTP / SFTP**         | How files are moved between computers             |
| **SMTP / IMAP / POP3** | How emails are sent and received                  |
| **SSH**                | How to securely control another computer remotely |
| **MQTT / CoAP**        | How small smart devices (IoT) send data           |

🌐 1. HTTP — HyperText Transfer Protocol
The main language of the web.
It’s how your browser asks a website for pages, images, or data.
Example: when you visit google.com, your browser says “Hey server, give me the homepage,” and the server sends it back.
🧭 Think of it like sending a letter and getting a reply.

🔒 2. HTTPS — HTTP Secure
Same as HTTP, but locked and encrypted.
It keeps your information safe from hackers (like when entering passwords or credit cards).
You’ll see the 🔒 padlock icon in the browser.
🛡️ Think of it like sending a sealed envelope instead of an open postcard.

💬 3. WebSocket (WS / WSS)
Lets your browser and a server talk back and forth instantly.
Both sides can send messages anytime without waiting.
Used in chats, games, and live notifications.
⚡ Like a phone call instead of sending letters.

📁 4. FTP — File Transfer Protocol
Used to move files between your computer and a server.
Web developers often use it to upload website files.
📤 Like dragging files into a shared online folder.

🔐 5. SFTP — Secure File Transfer Protocol
Same idea as FTP, but encrypted and safer.
It runs over SSH (Secure Shell).
🗝️ Like sending files in a locked briefcase instead of an open box.

✉️ 6. SMTP — Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Used to send emails from your email app to the mail server.
📨 Like putting your letter in a mailbox to send it.

📥 7. POP3 — Post Office Protocol v3
Used to download emails from the server to your device.
Once downloaded, they’re usually deleted from the server.
📬 Like picking up your mail and emptying your mailbox.

📂 8. IMAP — Internet Message Access Protocol
Also for email, but syncs messages between devices.
You can read, delete, or move emails, and all devices stay updated.
🔄 Like reading your mail but leaving it in the mailbox so you can check it later from anywhere.

🌍 9. MQTT — Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
Very lightweight protocol used for IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
Great for sensors and smart devices that send small data often.
🌡️ Like your smart thermostat sending tiny messages saying “temperature is 22°C.”

💡 10. CoAP — Constrained Application Protocol
Another IoT protocol like MQTT, but simpler and similar to HTTP.
Used for tiny devices that can’t handle heavy data.
📶 Like a very lightweight way for smart devices to talk.

⚙️ 11. gRPC — Google Remote Procedure Call
A modern way for computers or apps to talk directly and efficiently.
Used mostly between backend servers or microservices.
⚡ Like one program calling a function on another computer directly.

🧑‍💻 12. SSH — Secure Shell
Lets you remotely control another computer safely (like a server).
Used by developers and system admins.
🔐 Like a secure tunnel to control your computer from far away.
