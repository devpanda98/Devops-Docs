Ip address:
Ip address numbers should be in 0 to 255 number only like 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255

Representation of IP address in ipv4 format:

0-255   . 0-255  .0-255   . 0-255
--------|--------|--------|--------
4 bytes |4 bytes |4 bytes |4 bytes
8 bit   | 8bit   |8bit    |8bit

🧩 Subnets:
2 types of subnets: public and private 
Only difference between these 2 are private subnet doesn’t have access to internet while Public subnet does .

🧱 CIDR range(Classless Inter-Domain Routing): 
 
So lets say you have to give a CIDR range in your vpc 
Vpc is 172.126.10.0  and you provide CIDR range which gives 172.126.10.0 /27 ips then how you calculate it 
So you know Ip address has 32 bit , you can calculate from that 
Like  32 – 27 = 5
2 to power 5 = 32, total 32 ip I will get like 172.126.10.0  - 172.126.10.31
The reason: Binary structure of IP addresses
This is a really insightful question! You're asking why IP address ranges always come in powers of 2, like 2¹, 2², 2⁵, 2¹⁶ — but never 2⁹ or 2¹¹ usable addresses, for example. Let's break it down.
1.	IP addresses are built in binary.
o	IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long.
o	Every bit can have 2 possible values: 0 or 1.
o	So, the number of possible addresses is always some power of 2.


Parameter                              | Formula / Rule                 | Example (172.198.10.0/27)
--------------------------------   ----|------------------------------ -|------------------------------
Total IPs                              | 2^(32 - CIDR)                  | 2^(32-27) = 32
Usable IPs                             | 2^(32 - CIDR) - 2              | 32 - 2 = 30 usable
Network IP                             | First IP of the block          | 172.198.10.0
Broadcast IP                           | Network IP + Total IPs - 1     | 172.198.10.0 + 32 - 1 = 172.198.10.31
Subnet increment / Next subnet start   | Network IP + Total IPs         | 172.198.10.0 + 32 = 172.198.10.32
Host bits                              | 32 - CIDR                      | 32 - 27 = 5 bits for hosts
Valid subnet alignment                 | Starting octet must be multiple of block size in that octet | 32 IPs → third octet multiples of 2: 0,2,4,6,8,10…


🌐 OSI models (open system interconnection)	
----------------------------------------------------------
OSI HAS 7 LAYERS (APSTNDP in short):
1 Application (http, https)
2 presentation (syntax, security)
3 session (API, Socket)
4 Transport (TCP)
5 Networks(packets)
6 Data link(ethernet)
7 Physical ()

##  the first 3 layers are called software layers,  the last 3 layers are called the hardware layers and the middle one (transport layer) is it handles the data communication between the software and hardware layers .
Understand like 
(7) Application – You write the letter
(6) Presentation – Translate it
(5) Session – Organize the conversation
(4) Transport – Deliver in correct order
(3) Network – Choose best route
(2) Data Link – Deliver to correct device
(1) Physical – Wires, Wi-Fi, actual delivery
